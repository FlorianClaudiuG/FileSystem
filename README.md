# FileSystem

Year 1 Foundations in Computer Science Assignment. We were tasked with creating the logic for a program that allocates and deallocates 
memory for a file system. We were also given a test harness.

The code mostly fulfils the assignment spec, albeit it misses extra functionality and may have a few bugs that the test harness ignored.
My code is inside the "pool.c" and "block.c" files and their respective headers.
